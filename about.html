    <p>
        Hello, my name is Kaitlyn Cortez! I am currently a sophomore in college pursuing my love for graphic design! Some of my favorite graphic design projects I have done are ones that involve creating patterns and posters as well! Some adjectives I would use to describe myself are energetic, joyful, adaptable, and creative. 
        This website is meant to act as my portfolio to showcase my artwork as well as a way for me to make a business in the future to sell my work and create more projects. 
    </p>
